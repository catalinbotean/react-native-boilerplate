// Using smart scale all sizes below threshold levels are scaled proportional, same as "non-smart" scale.
// For larger devices (above threshold levels) scale will account for a ratio.
// For now a good ratio value I have found is 0.2 but we can adjust later.
// For smart scale if we set ratio to 1 it will be the same as "non-smart" scale.
